## Addressing-Missing-Data

### Overview:

Here I Imagine Myself as a financial data consultant, and an investor has tasked me with identifying new business opportunities. To help them decide which future companies to invest in, I will provide a list of current businesses valued at more than $1 billion. These are sometimes referred to as "unicorns." My client will use this information to learn about profitable businesses in general.

The investor has asked me to provide them with the following data:

#### - Companies in the hardware industry based in either Beijing, San Francisco, or London
#### - Companies in the artificial intelligence industry based in London
#### - A list of the top 20 countries sorted by sum of company valuations in each country, excluding United States, China, India, and United Kingdom
#### - A global valuation map of all countries except United States, China, India, and United Kingdom (a separate map for Europe is also required)
